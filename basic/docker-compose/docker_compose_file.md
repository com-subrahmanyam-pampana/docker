The docker-compose.yml file you provided is used to define and configure a Docker service for running a shell script. 

services
Services: This section defines the services that make up your application. Each service corresponds to a container and specifies how it should be built and run.
bash_script
bash_script: This is the name of the service. You can use any name here, and it will be used to reference this service in other Docker Compose commands and configurations.
build
build: This section tells Docker Compose how to build the Docker image for this service. It contains the following sub-options:

context: The context specifies the directory to use as the build context. In this case, . refers to the current directory where the docker-compose.yml file is located. The build context is sent to the Docker daemon and includes everything needed to build the Docker image.
entrypoint
entrypoint: This specifies the command to run when the container starts. In this case, my_bash_script.sh is the entrypoint. This means that when the container is launched, it will execute my_bash_script.sh as its main process.

How It Works
Build: When you run docker-compose up or docker-compose build, Docker Compose will build the Docker image for the bash_script service using the Dockerfile located in the current directory (due to context: .).

Run: Once the image is built, Docker Compose will start a container based on this image. The container will execute the my_bash_script.sh script as its main process because of the entrypoint setting.
